This is a temporary repository used to suppress deprecation warnings until our User Lifecycle team supports Facebook Limited Login. Once we upgrade to version 18.0.1, we can safely remove this repository.

The #frameworks-and-tools team is leading this effort in partnership with the UL team (RFC). With this repo, we unblock the rest of the guild and can safely upgrade to Xcode 26.
